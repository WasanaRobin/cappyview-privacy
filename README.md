# CappyView Documentation

This repository hosts the **public documentation and privacy policy** for **CappyView**, an internal Chrome extension for Natera case reviewers.

## 🌐 Live Site

The documentation is published via GitHub Pages at:  
**[https://wasanarobin.github.io/cappyview-privacy/](https://wasanarobin.github.io/cappyview-privacy/)**

## 📄 What's Inside

This repository contains:

- **Support** – Contact info, internal feedback form, and common solutions to troubleshoot complications.
- **Privacy Policy** – Required by Chrome Web Store, explains data handling and permissions
- **Security Documentation** – Details security practices and architecture
- **Third-Party Licenses** – Attribution for open-source components (DOMPurify, Flaticon icons)
- **About Page** – Overview of CappyView features and functionality

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository exists solely to provide publicly accessible documentation for CappyView. It does **not** contain the extension's source code, which remains private and is licensed for internal use by Natera, Inc.

### Why a Separate Repo?

Chrome Web Store requires extensions to have a publicly accessible privacy policy. Since CappyView is proprietary internal software, we use this public documentation repository to meet that requirement while keeping the extension code private.
