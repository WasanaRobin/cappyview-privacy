  <h1>Privacy Policy for CappyView</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 11, 2025</p>
  
  <div class="summary-box">
    <p><strong>Privacy Summary:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>CappyView does not collect, store, or transmit any user or patient data. All processing occurs locally in the browser.</strong></p>
    <p>This extension stores only non-sensitive user interface preferences on your device. No information ever leaves your computer.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>What CappyView Does</h2>
  <p>CappyView is a Chrome extension that enhances case management workflows by adding navigation tools, customization options, and productivity features to authorized workplace systems.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection & Storage</h2>
  
  <div class="notice">
    <strong>Important:</strong> CappyView processes case information only within the user's browser. No patient data, personal information, or sensitive content is transmitted, uploaded, or shared. All data remains on your device.
  </div>

  <p><strong>CappyView does NOT collect, transmit, or store:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Patient health information (PHI) or medical records</li>
    <li>Personal identifying information</li>
    <li>Case data or sensitive business information</li>
    <li>Usage analytics or telemetry</li>
    <li>Browsing history or activity outside specified domains</li>
    <li>Any data sent to external servers</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>CappyView DOES store locally (on your device only):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>User interface preferences (sidebar width, toolbar position, theme color)</li>
    <li>Display settings (PDF zoom level, table filter preferences)</li>
    <li>Temporary session data for image gallery performance (automatically cleared when gallery closes)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>All preference data is stored using Chrome's built-in <code>chrome.storage.local</code> and <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> APIs. This data consists solely of non-sensitive configuration values—UI settings only—and never includes patient information, case details, or any personally identifiable data.</p>

  <h2>Permissions Explained</h2>
  <p>CappyView requests the following Chrome permissions. Here's why each is needed:</p>

  <h3>Storage Permission</h3>
  <p>Used to save your UI preferences (sidebar width, toolbar state, theme color, PDF zoom level) locally on your device. No patient data or sensitive information is ever stored.</p>

  <h3>Scripting Permission</h3>
  <p>Used only on authorized workplace pages to run small, in-page DOM probes via <code>chrome.scripting.executeScript</code>. These probes discover related links (samples, support pages, and attachment PDFs) so the "Open / Close Tabs" tools can correctly identify which tabs belong to the active case. No remote code is executed, no scripts are injected into non-authorized sites, and the results never leave the user's machine.</p>

  <h3>Tabs Permission</h3>
  <p>Used to open and manage case-related tabs (Files, Images, Samples, Support pages) based on the current case you're viewing. CappyView does not access tabs outside the specified authorized domains and does not read your browsing history.</p>

  <h3>Web Navigation Permission</h3>
  <p>Detects when you navigate between pages in single-page applications to refresh toolbars and sidebars appropriately. Does not intercept, modify, or monitor network traffic.</p>

  <h3>Host Permissions</h3>
  <p>CappyView only operates on specific authorized workplace domains that you have legitimate access to as part of your job responsibilities. The extension cannot access any other websites or domains.</p>
  
  <div class="technical-details">
    <strong>Technical Note:</strong> This extension is designed for use within authorized organizational systems. Access is controlled by your organization's security policies. The extension operates exclusively on domains you are already authorized to access through your workplace credentials.
  </div>

    <li><strong>UIcons by Flaticon</strong> – Vector icons used in the user interface. These icons are bundled in the extension and require attribution per the Flaticon Free License.</li>
  </ul>
